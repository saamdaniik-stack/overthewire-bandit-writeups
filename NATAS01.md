# NATAS 01

In this level, the login page looked simple and showed no hints.
I checked the page source to see if anything was hidden.
Inside the HTML source, I found a comment.
That comment contained the password for the next level.
This showed that sensitive information should not be kept in page source.
Anyone can view the source code using a browser.
I used the password to move to NATAS 02.
